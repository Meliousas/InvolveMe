"Involve Me" 
(Android app written in Kotlin) 

This application is supposed to help people share their ideas about public space arrangment. 
Markers on the Google Map reflect places where users added their "initiatives". 
Those initiatives are simply their ideas how to adapt their common living space. 
Initiatives can be rated be other users, so "Involve Me" creates raliable statistics of what people need in their neighbourhood.

Wanna try it?
Just import project into Android studio and run :)
